# Greyvar

Greyvar is a game that is in development. Here's what it currently has; 

* **8-Bit art style** - because 8-bit is awesome
* **Multiplayer** - Online/LAN and Local shared-screen
* **Cross-platform** - works on Linux and Windows for now.
* **Controller support** - XBox 360 controller tested so far
* **Open Source** - Because Open Source is great :). This means there will always be a free version available. Maybe there will be paid distributions of it in the future though.

There are some fairly ambitious plans for the game in the future :) Follow to get updates!

## How do I play the game?

Greyvar is currently in heavy development, there isn't really much to "play" right now. Subscribe to updates above so you can play early versions.

Technically, as game is open source, and you can download the code and compile it yourself. However, instructions to do this aren't provided because it's not a good way to try the game.
