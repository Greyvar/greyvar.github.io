# Greyvar

Greyvar is a game that is in development. it currently;

* 8-Bit art style
* Multiplayer (Online/LAN and Local shared-screen), netcode is pretty buggy
* Cross-platform (works on Linux and Windows now), Android support planned.
* Supports all modern controllers (I use a XBox 360 controller in development) 

There are some fairly ambitious plans for it in the future, to support server-side game modes/modding for example. :)

## How do I play the game?

Greyvar is currently in heavy development, there isn't really much to "play" right now. Subscribe to updates above so you can play early versions.

Technically, as game is open source, and you can download the code and compile it yourself. However, instructions to do this aren't provided because it's not a good way to try the game.
