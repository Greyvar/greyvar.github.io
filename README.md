# Greyvar

Greyvar is a casual pace multiplayer co-op puzzle game. Weird and wonderful worlds of puzzles that include quests, logic puzzles, tower defence, building, farming, and exploration in a 8-bit art style.

* **Casual** - No health bars, no time limits, this is the sort of game you can
  play to de-stress and chill out with a friend!
* **Multiplayer co-op** - Online/LAN and Local shared-screen
* **Puzzles** - Every world has new an interesting puzzles, inspired by lots of
  gaming genres. You can create your own worlds with the world editor too!
* **8-Bit art style** - because 8-bit is awesome
* **Cross-platform** - works on Linux and Windows for now.
* **Controller support** - XBox 360 controller tested so far
* **Open Source** - Because Open Source is great :). This means there will always be a free version available. Maybe there will be paid distributions of it in the future though.

## How do I play the game?

Greyvar is currently in heavy development, there isn't really much to "play" right now. Subscribe to updates above so you can play early versions.

Technically, as game is open source, and you can download the code and compile it yourself. However, instructions to do this aren't provided because it's not a good way to try the game.
