# Greyvar

Greyvar is a casual pace multiplayer co-op puzzle game. Weird and wonderful worlds of puzzles that include quests, logic puzzles, tower defence, building, farming, and exploration in a 8-bit art style.

Here's a few bits and pieces about the game;

* **Casual** - No health bars, no time limits, this is the sort of game you can
  play to de-stress and chill out with a friend!
* **Multiplayer** - Online/LAN and Local shared-screen
* **8-Bit art style** - because 8-bit is awesome
* **Cross-platform** - works on Linux and Windows for now.
* **Controller support** - XBox 360 controller tested so far
* **Open Source** - Because Open Source is great :). This means there will always be a free version available. Maybe there will be paid distributions of it in the future though.

The game is currently in the **Development / Design** phase.

## How do I play the game?

Greyvar is currently in heavy development, there isn't really much to "play" right now. Subscribe to updates above so you can play early versions.

Technically, as game is open source, and you can download the code and compile it yourself. However, instructions to do this aren't provided because it's not a good way to try the game.
